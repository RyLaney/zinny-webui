# Zinny Web UI: A Simple Interface to Rate Films
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## What's the skinny on the cin√©?
Zinny Web UI provides a straightforward browser-based interface for rating films using surveys from [zinny-surveys](https://github.com/RyLaney/zinny-surveys). It connects to the Zinny API to manage surveys, ratings, and more.

## Reference Material: Original Spreadsheet
This repository includes the spreadsheet that inspired the design and goals of the zinny-survey specifications, zinny-api, and this user interface.

About the Spreadsheet:
Originally a standalone tool for evaluating and scoring, the spreadsheet served as a prototype for the Zinny.
While the current specification builds upon and extends the spreadsheet's functionality, the original spreadsheet remains useful for those who prefer a traditional tabular interface.
Where to Find It:
The Excel version spreadsheet can be found in the reference/ directory of this repository, and there is a Google Sheets version available for copying and editing.
